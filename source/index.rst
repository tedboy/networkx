Networkx API
============
Networkx API built using ``sphinx_rtd_theme``, with the page structured to my own liking.

.. important:: Content directly from official documentation page from `NetworkX <https://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html/>`__. This page created since I love the readthedoc Sphinx theme.

- ``|today|`` = |today|
- All modules for which code is available (`link <./_modules/index.html>`_)
- https://github.com/networkx/networkx/tree/master/doc/source/reference
